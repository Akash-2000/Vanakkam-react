What is npm?
    * npm is a software registry library or package which holds or helps us to 
    install packages into our app using the npm install command
    * npm helps us to managae our packages

2. what is parcel/Webpack?
    * parcel bundles our files and host in our local host
    * it increases developer performance by HMR - hot module Replace
    * it minifies, optimize our code
    * it removes unnecccesary code , do the code splitting

3. what is .parcel-cache?
   * .parcel-cache is a folder created when we create a build using the parcel
   * it contains the code using the code in this folder and dist parcel makes the bundling faster
   * and relods quickly

4. what is npx?
  * npx is a command used to exceute the package
  example npm install - (installs the package)
  meanwhile npx bundle index.html (creates a bundle out of the index.html )

5. Difference between dependencies & devDependency

 * Dependencies - are the packages that is essential to run our app on the server or after the build
 * Dev-dependencies - are the packages that is only useful for the development that this package is not goinf to use in production
                    so in order to reduce the size of the ndoe modules we install some files as dev dependency which not going to use on production

6. Tree shaking ?
   *  Tree shaking is a method followed by the parcel package which removes all the unused code so that we get a light and production ready build

7. Hot module replacement? 
  * Hot module replacement is a feature of parcel which is whenever a tag or items changes in the bundle it autmotically loads the new value
  by using the File watching alogrithim that parcel used whcih is written by c++

8. package.json and package-lock.json
  * package.json is a file created while using the npm init command it contains the list of the packages and dev dependcy taht we have in our app and other configurations
    which can update the package based on the ^ or ~ used
  * package.lock.json is a file created along with install a package it contains exact version of the package we used in the
    package.json

9. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json ?
  *  so far we have using the package.json with ^ caret symbol so it might install minor patches 
      autmotically wihch is undesirable
  * package-lock.json is a locfile that contains the information
    about dependcy wiht their exact version numbers that were installed 

  *No it is not good idea to push node_modules to github, it is autogenerated file when there is a change in either the node_module or package.json
10. what is node_modules ?
  * In the node_modules folder we have all dependcy related package or folder which is very helpful 
    during the development rather than depending on depency CDN links
  * node_modules is a auto-generated file while using the npm install "depenecy name" anything is autogenrated should not move to github

11. what is dist folder?
  * dist folder contains the build files
  * It contians the production build of your app 
  * set up your favorite http server so that a visitor served with index.html

12. browserlists?
   * browserslist pakcage helps our code to work on the different version of browser and different 
    browser also

1.  webpack -  Choose Webpack for complex, large-scale projects 
2. parcel - zero configuration ideal for simple devlopments
3. vite - vite for rapid development excellent choice for modern web applications
