1. JSX
 Jsx is a syntax extension for javascript, uses html syntax like structure which is used 
 to create the React element in a easier way and we also can add js in between the code 
 it makes the development very easy

2. React.createElement vs JSX
    Both are used to create react elements 
    It is very hard to write nested div in react.createEleement
    Itis very easy in Jsx
    It is hard to pass or execute javscript inside the create element

3. Benefits of JSX
    1. Makes the developer life easy
    2. easy readable code
    3. able to component composition easily
    4. able to use react fucntional componnet inside another componnet

4. Babel & Parcel role in Jsx
    When we write a jsx code it is not a valida javascript to execute but Babel
    is a beast when it sees the angular brackets it looks for the functional componnent
    and redner the data using the react.createElement

    parcel 
5. components
    in react every thing is a componet 
    1. Function or class componnent
    Functional components are simply javascript fucntions which return the JSX 

6 Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
    if we write react in app.js it is not able to in scripts unless you specified the 
    type as module which makes the script file code to treat as spearate module

7{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
These 3 are the writingg ways of react 
1. react element
2. react componnet
3. another way of wriiting componennt
