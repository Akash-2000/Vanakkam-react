When and why do we need lazy()?
- when we have more than 100 components in a project, the bundle.js file becomes increased in size
- it will be hard to laod the js in the browser which makes our website loads slow
- to overcome this issue we split the components based on the logic and only renders or create a spearte.js bundle
 only when needed it reduces the taking up unwanted space by the splited code
- it makes our app optimized

What is suspense?
- whenever we use lazy on the react project , when we click on the page or tries to move to the page
- react quickly navigate to the page before the code spliting done , it cause an error and not shown the results
- to overcome this issue we wrap the component with an suspense component given by the react which have a fallback
  which helps to show other component while code spliting is complete

Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to
synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator.
To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does
suspense fix this error?

-  suspense have a fallback which renders the old code here

Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?
 - Faster Initial Load Time  
 - Improved Performance
 - Simpler Maintenance
 - Better Mobile Performance

 - disadvantages
 - Initial Loading Delay


When do we and why do we need suspense?
